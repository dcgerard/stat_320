A study considered four beta-carotene capsule preparations: Solatene (30 mg), Roche (60 mg), and two from BASF (30 mg and 60 mg). To test their effectiveness in raising plasma-carotene levels, 23 volunteers were randomized to one of the four preparations, taking one pill every other day for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the plasma carotene level after prolonged ingestion.\n\nbetacar.csv\n\nPrepar: Preparation.\n\nPossible values: SOL, ROCHE, BASF-30, BASF-60.\n\nId: Subject #\nBase1lvl: 1st Baseline Level\nBase2lvl: 2nd Baseline Level\nWk6lvl: Week 6 Level\nWk8lvl: Week 8 Level\nWk10lvl: Week 10 Level\nWk12lvl: Week 12 Level\n\n\n\n\nbirthweight\nThe birthweights of 1000 consecutive infants born at Boston City Hospital, which serves a low-income population.\n\nbirthweight.csv\n\nid: ID\nweight: Birthweight (oz)\n\n\n\n\nblood\nData from a case-control study investigated various plasma risk factors for breast cancer.

Forty-one pairs of twins visited a hospital in Victoria, Australia, where their bone density was measured. Participants also completed questionnaires providing information on their tobacco use, alcohol, coffee, and tea consumption, calcium intake from dairy products, menopausal and reproductive history, fracture history, use of oral contraceptives or estrogen replacement therapy, and physical activity levels. Tobacco consumption was measured in pack-years, with one pack-year defined as smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for one year.\n\nboneden.csv\n\nID: ID\nAge: Age (yrs)\nzyg: Twin type.\n\nPossible values: mz, dz\n\nTwin 1 Lighter Smoking Twin\n\nht1: Height (cm)\nwt1: Weight (kg)\ntea1: Tea (cups/week)\ncof1: Coffee (cups/week)\nalc1: Alcohol (drinks/week)\ncur1: Current Smoking (cigarettes/day)\nmen1: Menopause Status.\n\nPossible values: pre, post, unknown\n\npyr1: Pack-years smoking\nls1: Lumbar spine (g/cm\\(^2\\))\nfn1: Femoral neck (g/cm\\(^2\\))\nfs1: Femoral shaft (g/cm\\(^2\\))\n\nTwin 2 Heavier Smoking Twin\n\nht2: Height (cm)\nwt2: Weight (kg)\ntea2: Tea (cups/week)\ncof2: Coffee (cups/week)\nalc2: Alcohol (drinks/week)\ncur2: Current Smoking (cigarettes/day)\nmen2: Menopause Status.\n\nPossible values: pre, post, unknown\n\npyr2: Pack-years smoking\nls2: Lumbar spine (g/cm\\(^2\\))\nfn2: Femoral neck (g/cm\\(^2\\))\nfs2: Femoral shaft (g/cm\\(^2\\))\n\n\n\n\n\nbotox\nA study on patients with piriformis syndrome compared the effects of three types of injections: triamcinolone with lidocaine (TL), a placebo (Placebo), and Botox (Botox). The patients were randomly assigned to these groups in a 3:1:2 ratio and received injections directly into the piriformis muscle. They were evaluated at 2 weeks, 1 month, and monthly up to 17 months, though many missed visits. Improvement in pain was measured on a scale from 0% to 100% (higher means more improved). The study involved 69 patients, with one having the condition in both legs. The goal was to compare the efficacy between the groups, considering age, gender, and affected side as potential influencing factors.\n\nbotox.csv\n\nID: ID\ngroup:\n\nPossible values: TL, Placebo, Botox\n\nside: left (L), middle (M), or right (R).\ngender: male or female\nage: in years\npain0: pain score month 0\npain05: pain score month 0.5\npain1: pain score month 1\npain2: pain score month 2\npain3: pain score month 3\npain4: pain score month 4\npain5: pain score month 5\npain6: pain score month 6\npain7: pain score month 7\npain8: pain score month 8\npain9: pain score month 9\npain10: pain score month 10\npain11: pain score month 11\npain12: pain score month 12\npain13: pain score month 13\npain14: pain score month 14\npain15: pain score month 15\npain16: pain score month 16\npain17: pain score month 17\n\n\n\n\nbreast\nThe data set includes 1200 postmenopausal women from the NHS, free of cancer in 1990. Of these, 200 were using postmenopausal hormones (PMH) in 1990, and 1000 had never used them. The study aimed to link PMH use in 1990 to breast cancer incidence from 1990 to 2000. Fifty-three women developed breast cancer during this period. PMH use was categorized by current use and duration of use in 1990, with separate durations for estrogen and estrogen plus progesterone. Each woman has a return date for the 1990 questionnaire and a follow-up date, which is either the date of breast cancer diagnosis or the date of the last questionnaire by 2000. The file also includes data on other breast cancer risk factors as of 1990.\n\nbreast.csv\n\nId: ID\ncase: Treatment\n\nPossible values: case,control\n\nage: age\nagemenar: age at menarche\nagemenop: age at menopause\nafb: age at first birth 98=nullip\nparity: parity\nbbd: Benign Breast disease.\n\nPossible values: yes, no\n\nfamhx: family history breast cancer.\n\nPossible values: yes, no\n\nbmi: BMI (kg/m**2)\nhgt: Height (inches)\nalcohol: Alcohol use (grams/day)\npmh: PMH status.\n\nPossible values: never user, current user\n\ndur3: Duration of Estrogen use (months)\ndur4: Duration of Estrogen + progesterone use (months)\ncsmk: Current Smoker.\n\nPossible values: yes, no\n\npsmk: Past smoker.\n\nPossible values: yes, no\n\nfoluptm: Months of follow up.

However, post-approval studies indicate a risk of peripheral neuropathy, leading to updated safety labeling.\nA small clinical trial tested the safety and effectiveness of two fluoroquinolone eye drops (drugs M and G) and a placebo (drug P) for bacterial eye infections. Ninety-three subjects were randomly assigned to three groups, each receiving one active drug and a placebo in opposite eyes. Participants used the drops four times daily for 10 days. The primary outcome was corneal sensitivity, measured in millimeters, with higher values indicating more normal sensitivity.\nCorneal sensitivity was assessed at baseline, 7 days, and 14 days, with measurements taken from the central cornea and four quadrants (superior, inferior, temporal, nasal).\n\ncorneal.csv\n\nid: ID\ntr: Treatment.\n\nPossible values: M, G, P\n\nc1: Central visit 1\ns1: Superior visit 1\ni1: Inferior Visit 1\nt1: Temporal visit 1\nn1: Nasal Visit 1\nc2: Central Visit 2(day 7)\ns2: Superior Visit 2\ni2: Inferior Visit 2\nt2: Temporal Visit 2\nn2: Nasal Visit 2\nc3: Central Visit 3(day 14)\ns3: Superior Visit 3\ni3: Inferior Visit 3\nt3: Temporal Visit 3\nn3: Nasal Visit 3\n\n\n\n\ndiabetes\nType I diabetes is common in children and requires regular insulin shots to prevent long-term complications like neurologic, vision, kidney issues, heart disease, and premature death.\nThe impact of diabetes control on childhood growth is less clear. To study this, adolescent boys aged 9−15 were examined about every 3 months. Each exam measured diabetes control using glycosylated hemoglobin (HgbA1c), where higher HgbA1c indicates poorer control (normal &lt;7.0). Age, height, and weight were also recorded. Data includes 94 boys over 910 visits.\nThe main question is the overall relationship between glycemic control and growth, primarily weight, for the entire group, not individual cases.\n\ndiabetes.csv\n\nID: ID\nmon_a1c: Month A1c\nday_a1c: Day A1c\nyr_a1c: Yr A1c\nage_yrs: Age in years\ngly_a1c: Hemoglobin A1c\nht_cm: Height in cm\nwt_kg: Weight in kg\n\n\n\n\near\nThis dataset includes 203 children with acute otitis media (OME) from a randomized clinical trial.

Despite their toxicity and the development of new antibiotics, aminoglycosides remain widely used. Choosing the right aminoglycoside depends on the clinical situation, antimicrobial spectrum, cost, and side effects like nephrotoxicity and auditory toxicity. Numerous trials comparing these antibiotics have varied in design and conclusions, often lacking sufficient sample sizes to detect small differences.\nTo better understand their true effects, a meta-analysis of all randomized trials was conducted. This analysis included 45 trials from 1975 to 1985, comparing amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, sisomicin, and tobramycin. Data from 37 trials were suitable for comparison, focusing on efficacy, nephrotoxicity, and auditory toxicity. Efficacy was defined by bacterial or clinical response as reported by each trial, nephrotoxicity by the percentage of kidney-related toxic events reported, and auditory toxicity by the diffence in pre- and post-treatment audiograms. The data is organized into three sets: eff.csv, nephro.csv, and oto.csv, with separate records for each antibiotic and endpoint.\n\neff.csv\n\nName: Study name\nId: Study Number\nEndpnt: Endpoint, 1 = efficacy\nAntibio: Antibiotic.\n\nPossible values: Amikacin, Gentamicin, Netilmicin, Sisomycin, Tobramycin.\n\nSamp_sz: Sample Size\nCured: Number Cured\n\nnephro.csv\n\nname: Study name\nid: Study number\nEndpnt: Endpoint 2 = nephrotoxicity\nAntibio: Antibiotic.\n\nPossible values: Amikacin, Gentamicin, Netilmicin, Sisomycin, Tobramycin\n\nSamp_sz: Sample size\nSide_eff: Number with side effects\n\noto.csv\n\nName: Study Name\nId: Study Number\nEndpnt: Endpoint.\n\nPossible values: efficacy, nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity.\n\nAntibio: Antibiotic.\n\nPossible values: Amikacin, Gentamicin, Netilmicin, Sisomycin, Tobramycin.\n\nSamp_sz: Sample Size\nSide_eff: Number with side effect\n\n\n\n\nendocrin\nThe data set contains split-sample plasma measurements of four hormones for each of five subjects, all from one laboratory.\n\nendocrin.csv\n\nSubject: Subject number\nReplicat: Replicate number\nEstrone: Estrone\nEstradol: Estradiol\nAndroste: Androstenedione\nTestost: Testosterone\n\n\n\n\nestradl\nObesity is common in American society and a risk factor for breast cancer in postmenopausal women, possibly due to increased estrogen levels, particularly serum estradiol. Researchers studied 151 African American and 60 Caucasian premenopausal women, measuring adiposity using body mass index (BMI) (a measure of overall adioposity) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) (a measure of abdominal adioposity). They also obtained a complete hormonal profile, including serum estradiol, and assessed other breast cancer risk factors: ethnicity, age, number of children, age at first birth, presence of children, and age at menarche.\n\nestradl.csv\n\nId: Identification number\nEstradl: Estradiol\nEthnic: Ethnicity.\n\nPossible values: African-American, Caucasian\n\nEntage: Age\nNumchild: Parity, number of children\nAgefbo: Age at 1st birth (=0 if numchild=0)\nAnykids: any children.\n\nPossible values: yes, no.\n\nAgemenar: age at menarche\nBMI: Body Mass Index\nWHR: waist-hip ratio\n\n\n\n\nestrogen\nThree distinct two-period crossover studies were conducted with different subject groups, measuring systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Researchers aimed to determine how these hormones affect the flow rates and pH values of these secretions.\nWhite Leghorn hens, aged 14-29 weeks, were surgically fitted with cannulas for collecting secretions and a jugular cannula for hormone infusion. Each hen underwent one trial per day, as long as her cannulas remained functional, leading to varying trial numbers per hen.\nEach trial started with a 20-minute saline infusion, followed by the collection of pancreatic and biliary secretions. The flow rates and pH values were measured. This was followed by a 40-minute hormone infusion, with measurements repeated afterward.\nThe data set “hormone.csv” includes data for the four hormones and saline, with each trial recorded as one entry and 11 associated variables.\n\nhormone.csv\n\nID: ID\nBilsecpr: Biliary secretion-pre\nBilphpr: Biliary pH-pre\nPansecpr: Pancreatic secretion-pre\nPanphpr: Pancreatic pH-pre\nDose: Dose\nBilsecpt: Biliary secretion-post\nBilphpt: Biliary pH-post\nPansecpt: Pancreatic secretion-post\nPanphpt: Pancreatic pH-post\nHormone: Hormone.\n\nPossible values: SAL, APP, CCK, SEC, VIP.\n\n\n\n\n\nhospital\nThese data are part of a larger data set gathered from individuals discharged from a specific Pennsylvania hospital.

Blood lead levels were measured, categorizing 46 children with levels ≥ 40 μg/mL as the exposed group. Another 78 children with levels &lt; 40 μg/mL functioned as the control group. Key outcomes included finger–wrist taps (neurological function) and Wechsler full-scale IQ scores.\nOther behavioral effects of lead include hyperactivity. In this study, parents also rated their children’s hyperactivity on a scale from 0 (normal) to 3 (very hyperactive).

Some patients become legally blind by 30, while others retain central vision past 60. A specific gene linked RP has been identified whose transmision is autosomal dominant. The disease progression is tracked using electroretinogram (ERG), measuring retinal electrical activity, which decreases as RP advances, affecting routine activities like driving and walking at night.\nTo test if sunlight exposure harms RP patients, researchers introduced the RP gene into mice, creating “RP mice.” These mice were divided into light, dim, and dark lighting conditions from birth. A control group of normal mice was also subjected to similar conditions. ERG amplitudes (BAMP and AAMP) were measured at 15, 20, and 35 days of life for RP mice, and only BAMP was measured for normal mice.\n\nmice.csv\n\nId: ID\nGroup: GROUP.\n\nPossible values: RP, NORMAL\n\nTrtgrp: TREATMENT GROUP.\n\nPossible values: LIGHT, DIM, DARK.\n\nAge: AGE (days)\nB_amp: B AMP\nA_amp: A AMP\n\n\n\n\nnifed\nA clinical trial tested the effectiveness of nifedipine in reducing chest pain in hospitalized angina patients. The study lasted 14 days unless patients were withdrawn, discharged, or died. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either nifedipine or propranolol, starting at a standard dosage. If pain persisted or recurred, the dosage was increased in pre-specified steps. Patients in both groups could also receive nitrates as needed to control pain. The primary goal was to compare pain relief between nifedipine and propranolol, with a secondary goal of examining their effects on heart rate and blood pressure.\n\nnifed.csv\n\nId: ID\ntrtgrp: Treatment group,\n\nN = nifedipine\nP = placebo\n\nbashrtrt: Baseline heart rate immediately prior to randomization (beats/min)\nlv1hrtrt: Level 1 heart rate, Highest heart rate and systolic blood pressure at baseline and each level of therapy respectively (beats/min)\nlv2hrtrt: Level 2 heart rate (beats/min)\nlv3hrtrt: Level 3 heart rate (beats/min)\nbassys: Baseline systolic bp immediately prior to randomization (mm Hg)\nlv1sys: Level 1 systolic bp (mm Hg)\nlv2sys: Level 2 systolic bp (mm Hg)\nlv3sys: Level 3 systolic bp (mm Hg)\n\n\nMissing values indicate that either (a) the patient withdrew from the study prior to entering this level of therapy (b) the patient achieved pain relief prior to reaching this level or therapy, (c) the patient encountered this level of therapy, but this particular piece of data was missing.\n\n\npiriform\nA study evaluated the FAIR test (hip flexion, adduction, and internal rotation) for diagnosing piriformis syndrome (PS), which affects the piriformis muscle in the buttock, causing lumbar and sciatic pain. The test measures nerve-conduction velocity differences between an aggravating and a neutral posture, with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of PS. Data from 142 participants without PS and 489 with PS (diagnosed clinically) are available. A FAIR test score of ≥ 1.86 ms is proposed to define a positive result.

On the day they quit, their carbon monoxide (CO) levels were measured, and the time since their last cigarette was recorded. This CO level serves as an indicator of the number of cigarettes smoked daily before quitting but is influenced by the time since the last cigarette. Therefore, a “corrected CO level” was provided, adjusted for this time. Participant age, sex, and self-reported daily cigarette consumption were also recorded. The participants were followed for a year to determine the number of days they remained abstinent, ranging from 0 to 365 days.\n\nsmoke.csv\n\nID: ID number\nAge: age\nGender: Gender.\n\nPossible values: male, female\n\nCig_day: Cigarettes/day\nCO: Carbon monoxide (CO) (X 10)\nMin_last: Minutes elapsed since last cigarette\nLogCOadj: Log CO Adj * (X 1000).

It involved 624 women from Basel, Switzerland, who had high phenacetin intake (study group) and 626 women with low or no phenacetin intake (control group). The study used urine N-acetyl-P-aminophenyl (NAPAP) levels to measure recent phenacetin use, dividing the study group into high-NAPAP and low-NAPAP subgroups. Both subgroups had higher NAPAP levels than the control group. The women were examined in 1967-1968 and again in 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1975, and 1978, with kidney function assessed through various laboratory tests, including serum-creatinine levels.\n\nswiss.csv\n\nID: ID\nage: age (yrs)\ngroup: Group.\n\nPossible values: High NAPAP, Low NAPAP, control\n\ncreat_68: Serum Creatinine 1968 (mg/dL)\ncreat_69: Serum Creatinine 1969 (mg/dL)\ncreat_70: Serum Creatinine 1970 (mg/dL)\ncreat_71: Serum Creatinine 1971 (mg/dL)\ncreat_72: Serum Creatinine 1972 (mg/dL)\ncreat_75: Serum Creatinine 1975 (mg/dL)\ncreat_78: Serum Creatinine 1978 (mg/dL)\n\n\n\n\ntear\nA pilot study was conducted to evaluate an eye drop’s effectiveness in preventing dry eye, measured by tear breakup time (TBUT).

Treatments include rest, heat, and anti-inflammatory medications like Motrin (ibuprofen). A clinical trial with 87 participants compared the effectiveness of Motrin vs. placebo. Participants were randomly divided into two groups: Group A received Motrin for 3 weeks, followed by a 2-week washout period, and then placebo for 3 weeks; Group B received the treatments in reverse order. Pain levels were measured on a 1-6 scale (1 = worse, 6 = completely improved) at the end of each treatment and washout period. The comparison was made (i) during maximum activity, (ii) 12 hours following maximum activity, (iii) during the average day, and (iv) by overall impression of drug efficacy.\n\ntennis2.csv\n\nid: ID\nage: Age\nsex: Sex.\n\nPossible values: male, female\n\ndrg_ord: Drug order.\n\nPossible values: MOTRIN-PLACEBO, PLACEBO-MOTRIN\n\nPeriod 2 = Pain scores after the first active drug period compared with baseline\n\npainmx_2: During study period, pain during maximum activity vs baesline\n\n1 = Worse\n2 = Unchanged\n3 = Slightly improved (25%)\n4 = Moderately improved (50%)\n5 = Mostly improved (75%)\n6 = Completely improved\n\npain12_2: Within 12 hours following maximal activity, compared to same period at baseline (same code as painmx_2)\npainav_2: During the average day of study period pain vs. baseline (same code as painmx_2)\npainov_2: Overall impression of drug efficacy vs. baseline (same code as painmx_2)\n\nPeriod 3 = Pain scores after the washout period compared with baseline\n\npainmx_3: During study period, pain during maximum activity vs baseline (same code as painmx_2)\npain12_3: Within 12 hours following maximal activity, compared to same period at baseline (same code as painmx_2)\npainav_3: During the average day of study period pain vs baseline (same code as painmx_2)\npainov_3: Overall impression of drug efficacy vs baseline (same code as painmx_2)\n\nPeriod 4 = Pain scores after the second active drug period compared with baseline\n\npainmx_4: During study period, pain during maximum activity vs baseline (same code as painmx_2)\npain12_4: Within 12 hours following maximal activity, compared to same period at baseline (same code as painmx_2)\npainav_4: During the average day of study period pain vs baseline (same code as painmx_2)\npainov_4: Overall impression of drug efficacy vs baseline (same code as painmx_2)\n\n\n\n\n\nvalid\nThe food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) is a common tool in dietary epidemiology to assess food consumption. It asks individuals to report their typical daily servings of over 100 food items from the past year, and a food-composition table calculates nutrient intakes. While FFQs are inexpensive, they are less accurate than diet records (DR), where participants document their weekly food intake, and a nutritionist calculates nutrient intakes. In a validation study, 173 nurses from the Nurses’ Health Study completed 4 weeks of diet records and an FFQ. Data for saturated fat, total fat, alcohol consumption, and caloric intake from both methods recorded here.\n\nvalid.csv\n\nId: ID number\nsfat_dr: Saturated fat-DR\nsfat_ffq: Saturated fat-FFQ\ntfat_dr: Total fat-DR\ntfat_ffq: Total fat-FFQ\nalco_dr: Alcohol consumption-DR\nalco_ffq: Alcohol consumption-FFQ\ncal_dr: Total calories-DR\ncal_ffq: Total calories-FFQ\n\n\n\n\nwales\nA study in South Wales investigated the hereditary factors of blood pressure in 623 individuals (propositii) over age 5 from two populations.

Brooks/Cole, Boston, MA, USA.\n\n\nThere will be occasional readings from other sources, such as journal articles, for class discussion or for homework assignments. These will be posted in Blackboard or links will be given to find these online.\n\n\n\nCourse Content and Learning Objectives\nSTAT-320 is an introduction to the statistical methodology commonly used in public health, medical, and biological studies. This course emphasizes working with data and communicating statistical ideas. A breadth of topics will be covered including: study design, tests of significance, confidence intervals, t-procedures, chi-square and Fisher’s exact test, linear regression, logistic regression, analysis of variance, nonparametric methods, and more advanced topics as time permits. The R computer program will be used to conduct analyses.\nThe major focus for this course is the ideas behind, and the methods for, drawing conclusions about a population from a sample. At the end of this course you will be expected to identify the major concepts related to statistical reasoning and to statistical inferences for drawing such conclusions, recognize how these concepts are used in disciplines related to health and medicine, and implement the methods yourself in statistical analyses using the methods covered. In particular, you are expected to be able to (1) identify the appropriate statistical model or models for a given analysis, (2) write the model in the correct notation, (3) implement the model in the R software package on a given set of data, (4) interpret the output in the context of the study, (5) diagnose model deficiences, (6) suggest improvements to the model if necessary, and (7) summarize the results of the analysis. Work will be a balance between understanding the concepts underlying a method, implementation of the method, and interpretation of the results.\n\n\nGrading\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nHomeworks\n40%\n\n\nMidterm 1\n20%\n\n\nMidterm 2\n20%\n\n\nMidterm 3\n20%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMidterms:\n\nNot officially cumulative. But all material in Statistics builds off of previous material, so effectively cumulative.\nYou can bring a 1 page (8.5’’ by 11’’ piece of paper) cheat sheet that is handwritten (no typing). You can use both sides.\nNo other resources are allowed. If you touch your phone/computer/smart watch/etc during the midterm then that is an automatic fail for the course.\n\nHomeworks:\n\nHomeworks are really just meant to help you prepare for the midterms. You can use generative AI if you want. But you won’t get any other study aids, so I wouldn’t except to check my work after I’ve done all of the problems.\n\n\nUsual grade cutoffs will be used:\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nLower\nUpper\n\n\n\n\nA\n93\n100\n\n\nA-\n90\n92\n\n\nB+\n88\n89\n\n\nB\n83\n87\n\n\nB-\n80\n82\n\n\nC+\n78\n79\n\n\nC\n73\n77\n\n\nC-\n70\n72\n\n\nD\n60\n69\n\n\nF\n0\n59\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual assignments will not be curved. However, at the discretion of the instructor, the overall course grade at the end of the semester may be curved.\n\n\nLate Work Policy\n\nAll assignments must be submitted on the day they are due.\nHomeworks will typically be due on Mondays by end-of-day.\nEach student will have two three-day extensions, where you can turn in the assignment on Thursday by end-of-day.\nPlease just let me know ahead of time that you will be using one of your two extensions.\nPlease do not tell me why you need the extension. Any reason is a fine reason.\nAny homeworks not submitted by the due date will receive a grade of 0.\n\n\n\nComputing and Software\nWe will use the R computing language to complete some assignment questions. R is free and may be downloaded from the R website (http://cran.r-project.org/). In addition, I highly recommend you interface with R through the free RStudio IDE (https://www.rstudio.com/). R and RStudio are also available on computers in the Anderson Computing Complex, the Center for Teaching, Research, and Learning Lab (CTRL) in Hurst Hall, in addition to various labs across campus. R Studio may also be run from your web browser using American University’s Virtual Applications System. Please see me during office hours if you have questions regarding R.\n\n\nData\nData sets for homeworks assignments and examples from the textbook are available on the Data page. These are cleaned versions of the data from the book’s companion website. Other data sets needed for class will be posted in Canvas\n\n\nComputers, phones, other electronic devices in class\nUse common sense and be courteous of your peers. You may take notes electronically if that is your preferred method. Phones and other devices should be off or set to silent during class.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nStandards of academic conduct are set forth in the university’s Academic Integrity Code. By registering for this course, students have acknowledged their awareness of the Academic Integrity Code and they are obliged to become familiar with their rights and responsibilities as defined by the Code. Violations of the Academic Integrity Code will not be treated lightly and disciplinary action will be taken should violations occur. This includes cheating, fabrication, and plagiarism.\nI expect you to work with others and me, and I expect you to use online resources as you work on your assignments However, your submissions must be composed of your own thoughts, coding, and words. You should be able to explain your work on assignments/projects and your rationale. Based on your explanation (or lack thereof), I may modify your grade.\nYou can use generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT, CoPilot, etc) on the homeworks if you want. But\n\nThese are your only study exercises for the midterms. So I wouldn’t use AI to do them for me except to check my work after I am done.\nYou are still expected to “own” all of your responses. I reserve the right to ask you to explain any of your solutions. If you write something weird or too advanced in the homework, I’ll call you in and ask you questions about it. Based on your explanation (or lack thereof), I may modify your grade.\n\nNo resources are allowed for the midterm except the 1 page (8.5’’ by 11’’) handwritten cheat sheet (and a pen or pencil, of course). If you touch your phone/computer/smart watch/etc during the midterm then that is an automatic fail for the course.\nAll solutions that I provide are under my copyright. These solutions are for personal use only and may not be distributed to anyone else. Giving these solutions to others, including other students or posting them on the internet, is a violation of my copyright and a violation of the student code of conduct.\n\n\n\nSharing Course Content:\nStudents are not permitted to make visual or audio recordings (including livestreams) of lectures or any class-related content or use any type of recording device unless prior permission from the instructor is obtained and there are no objections from any student in the class. If permission is granted, only students registered in the course may use or share recordings and any electronic copies of course materials (e.g., PowerPoints, formulas, lecture notes, and any discussions – online or otherwise). Use is limited to educational purposes even after the end of the course. Exceptions will be made for students who present a signed Letter of Accommodation from the Academic Support and Access Center. Further details are available from the ASAC website.\n\n\nSyllabus Change Policy\nThis syllabus is a guide for the course and is subject to change with advanced notice. These changes may come via Canvas. Make sure to check Canvas announcements regularly. You are accountable for all such communications."
