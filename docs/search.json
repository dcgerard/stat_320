But you need to know some tools to summarize/plot/model data.\nR is free, widely used, more generally applicable (beyond linear regression), and a useful tool for reproducibility. So this is what we will use.\nPython would have been a good choice too, but it is worse at basic stats (this is controversial)."

    "text": "Variables\n\nA variable stores a value. You use the assignment operator “&lt;-” to assign values to variables. For example, we can assign the value of 10 to the variable x.\n\nx &lt;- 10\n\n\nIt is possible to use =, and I think there is nothing wrong with that. But for some reason the field has decided to only use &lt;-, so you should too.\n\nWhenever we use x later, it will use the value of 10\n\nx\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nThis is useful because you can reuse this value over and over again:\n\ny &lt;- 0\nx + y\nx * y\nx / y\nx - y\n\nTo assign a “string” (a fancy way to say a word) to x, put the string in quotes. For example, we can assign the value of \"Hello World\" to x.\n\nx &lt;- \"Hello World\"\nx\n\n[1] \"Hello World\""

Let’s look at a simple function that takes the log of a number:\n\nlog(x = 4, base = 2)\n\nThe inputs are called “arguments”. Generally, every function will be for the form:\n\nfunction_name(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, ...)\n\nIf you do not specify the name of the argument, R will assume you are assigning in their order.\n\nlog(4, 2)\n\nYou can change the order of the arguments if you specify them.\n\nlog(base = 2, x = 4)\n\nTo see the list of all possible arguments of a function, use the help() function:\n\nhelp(log)\n\nIn the help file, there are often default values for an argument. For example, the following indicates the the default value of base is exp(1).\n\nlog(x, base = exp(1))\n\nThis indicates that you can omit the base argument and R will assume that it should be exp(1).\n\nlog(x = 4, base = exp(1))\n\n[1] 1.386\n\nlog(x = 4)\n\n[1] 1.386\n\n\nIf an argument does not have a default, then it must be specified when calling a function.\nType this:\n\nlog(x = 4,\n\nThe “+” indicates that R is expecting more input (you forgot either a parentheses or a quotation mark). You can get back to the prompt by hitting the ESCAPE key."

    "text": "Course Content and Learning Objectives\nSTAT-320 is an introduction to the statistical methodology commonly used in public health, medical, and biological studies. This course emphasizes working with data and communicating statistical ideas. A breadth of topics will be covered including: study design, tests of significance, confidence intervals, t-procedures, chi-square and Fisher’s exact test, linear regression, logistic regression, analysis of variance, nonparametric methods, and more advanced topics as time permits. The R computer program will be used to conduct analyses.\nThe major focus for this course is the ideas behind, and the methods for, drawing conclusions about a population from a sample. At the end of this course you will be expected to identify the major concepts related to statistical reasoning and to statistical inferences for drawing such conclusions, recognize how these concepts are used in disciplines related to health and medicine, and implement the methods yourself in statistical analyses using the methods covered. In particular, you are expected to be able to (1) identify the appropriate statistical model or models for a given analysis, (2) write the model in the correct notation, (3) implement the model in the R software package on a given set of data, (4) interpret the output in the context of the study, (5) diagnose model deficiences, (6) suggest improvements to the model if necessary, and (7) summarize the results of the analysis. Work will be a balance between understanding the concepts underlying a method, implementation of the method, and interpretation of the results."

You can do this by placing code within `r `.\nI used this in the previous section for automatically writing the date.\n\nmy_name &lt;- \"David\"\n\nThen “my name is `r my_name`” will result in “my name is David”.\nFor a more realistic example, you might calculate the \\(p\\)-value from a linear regression, then write this \\(p\\)-value in the paragraph of a report."

A clinical trial was planned to compare cancer incidence between a group taking beta-carotene capsules and a placebo group. The study considered four beta-carotene capsule preparations: Solatene (30 mg), Roche (60 mg), and two from BASF (30 mg and 60 mg). To test their effectiveness in raising plasma-carotene levels, 23 volunteers were randomized to one of the four preparations, taking one pill every other day for 12 weeks.

Of these, 200 were using postmenopausal hormones (PMH) in 1990, and 1000 had never used them. The study aimed to link PMH use in 1990 to breast cancer incidence from 1990 to 2000. Fifty-three women developed breast cancer during this period. PMH use was categorized by current use and duration of use in 1990, with separate durations for estrogen and estrogen plus progesterone. Each woman has a return date for the 1990 questionnaire and a follow-up date, which is either the date of breast cancer diagnosis or the date of the last questionnaire by 2000. The file also includes data on other breast cancer risk factors as of 1990.\n\nbreast.csv\n\nId: ID\ncase: Treatment\n\nPossible values: case,control\n\nage: age\nagemenar: age at menarche\nagemenop: age at menopause\nafb: age at first birth 98=nullip\nparity: parity\nbbd: Benign Breast disease.\n\nPossible values: yes, no\n\nfamhx: family history breast cancer.\n\nPossible values: yes, no\n\nbmi: BMI (kg/m**2)\nhgt: Height (inches)\nalcohol: Alcohol use (grams/day)\npmh: PMH status.\n\nPossible values: never user, current user\n\ndur3: Duration of Estrogen use (months)\ndur4: Duration of Estrogen + progesterone use (months)\ncsmk: Current Smoker.\n\nPossible values: yes, no\n\npsmk: Past smoker.\n\nPossible values: yes, no\n\nfoluptm: Months of follow up.

However, post-approval studies indicate a risk of peripheral neuropathy, leading to updated safety labeling.\nA small clinical trial tested the safety and effectiveness of two fluoroquinolone eye drops (drugs M and G) and a placebo (drug P) for bacterial eye infections. Ninety-three subjects were randomly assigned to three groups, each receiving one active drug and a placebo in opposite eyes. Participants used the drops four times daily for 10 days. The primary outcome was corneal sensitivity, measured in millimeters, with higher values indicating more normal sensitivity.\nCorneal sensitivity was assessed at baseline, 7 days, and 14 days, with measurements taken from the central cornea and four quadrants (superior, inferior, temporal, nasal).\n\ncorneal.csv\n\nid: ID\ntr: Treatment.\n\nPossible values: M, G, P\n\nc1: Central visit 1\ns1: Superior visit 1\ni1: Inferior Visit 1\nt1: Temporal visit 1\nn1: Nasal Visit 1\nc2: Central Visit 2(day 7)\ns2: Superior Visit 2\ni2: Inferior Visit 2\nt2: Temporal Visit 2\nn2: Nasal Visit 2\nc3: Central Visit 3(day 14)\ns3: Superior Visit 3\ni3: Inferior Visit 3\nt3: Temporal Visit 3\nn3: Nasal Visit 3\n\n\n\n\ndiabetes\nType I diabetes is common in children and requires regular insulin shots to prevent long-term complications like neurologic, vision, kidney issues, heart disease, and premature death.\nThe impact of diabetes control on childhood growth is less clear. To study this, adolescent boys aged 9−15 were examined about every 3 months. Each exam measured diabetes control using glycosylated hemoglobin (HgbA1c), where higher HgbA1c indicates poorer control (normal &lt;7.0). Age, height, and weight were also recorded. Data includes 94 boys over 910 visits.\nThe main question is the overall relationship between glycemic control and growth, primarily weight, for the entire group, not individual cases.\n\ndiabetes.csv\n\nID: ID\nmon_a1c: Month A1c\nday_a1c: Day A1c\nyr_a1c: Yr A1c\nage_yrs: Age in years\ngly_a1c: Hemoglobin A1c\nht_cm: Height in cm\nwt_kg: Weight in kg\n\n\n\n\near\nThis dataset includes 203 children with acute otitis media (OME) from a randomized clinical trial.

Despite their toxicity and the development of new antibiotics, aminoglycosides remain widely used. Choosing the right aminoglycoside depends on the clinical situation, antimicrobial spectrum, cost, and side effects like nephrotoxicity and auditory toxicity. Numerous trials comparing these antibiotics have varied in design and conclusions, often lacking sufficient sample sizes to detect small differences.\nTo better understand their true effects, a meta-analysis of all randomized trials was conducted. This analysis included 45 trials from 1975 to 1985, comparing amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, sisomicin, and tobramycin. Data from 37 trials were suitable for comparison, focusing on efficacy, nephrotoxicity, and auditory toxicity. Efficacy was defined by bacterial or clinical response as reported by each trial, nephrotoxicity by the percentage of kidney-related toxic events reported, and auditory toxicity by the diffence in pre- and post-treatment audiograms.
