- Consider the birthweight data:
  ```{r}
  #| message: false
  library(tidyverse)
  birthweight <- read_csv("https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_320/data/birthweight.csv")
  ggplot(birthweight, aes(x = weight)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "white", color = "black")
  ```

- Let's take samples of size $n$ = 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 from this distribution *with replacement*. For each sample size, we college 10000 repeat samples, each time calculating the sample mean $\bar{X}$, to obtain $\bar{X}_1,\bar{X}_2,\ldots,\bar{X}_{10000}$. Below are histograms of these $\bar{X}$'s

- The distribution of the $\bar{X}$'s has smaller and smaller variance as the sample size increases since $\mathrm{var}(\bar{X}) = \sigma^2/n$.

- The distribution of the $\bar{X}$'s gets closer to a normal as the sample size increases. Though it's already sufficiently normal for most purposes once $n = 10$.

- The true mean $\mu$ is the vertical dashed red line. You see that the distribution of the sample mean has a mean of $\mu$, $\mathrm{E}[\bar{X}] = \mu$.
