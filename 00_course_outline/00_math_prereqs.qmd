We do not emphasize the mathematics underlying statistics in this course. However, you should have some familiarity with pre-calculus topics. Here are some facts you should know off the top of your head:


# Powers, Exponentials, Logarithms
- $e^{ab} = {e^{a}}^{b} = {e^{b}}^{a}$
- $e^{a+b+c} = e^a(e^{b+c}) = e^ae^be^c$
- $\log(ab) = \log(a) + \log(b)$
- $\log(a/b) = \log(a) - \log(b)$
- $x^ny^n = (xy)^n$

# Summations

- Capital-sigma notation is useful for writing sums of many numbers/variables:
    $$\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i = x_1 + x_2 + \cdots x_n$$
- If you sum a constant $n$ times, you get $n$ times that constant:
    $$\sum_{i = 1}^n a = an$$
- You can factor out multiplicative constants that don't depend on the summing index:
    $$\sum_{i = 1}^n cx_i = c\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i$$
- The order that you sum elements does not matter:
    $$\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i + y_i) = \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i + \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i$$
