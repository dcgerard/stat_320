# Learning Objectives

- Overview of the course plus some reminders from STAT 202/203/204
- P-values/confidence intervals.
- $t$-tests for means in R.
- Proportion tests in R.

# Probability and Distributions in R.

- **Distribution**: The possible values of a variable and how often it takes
  those values. 
  
- A **density** describes the distribution of a *quantitative* variable. 
  You can think of it as approximating a histogram. It is a curve where
  - The area under the curve between any two points is approximately the
    probability of being between those two points.
  - The total area under the curve is 1 (something must happen).
  - The curve is never negative (can't have negative probabilities).
  
- The density of birthweights in America:

  ![](./cartoons/birthweights.png){fig-alt="Density of birthweights."}\ 
  
- The distribution of many variables in Statistics approximate the 
  **normal distribution**.
    - If you know the mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution, then
      you know the whole distribution.
    - Larger standard deviation implies more spread out (larger and smaller values
      are both more likely).
    - Mean determines where the data are centered.

-   Normal densities with different means.

- The $t$-distribution shows up a lot in Statistics. 
  - It is also bell-curved but has "thicker tails" (more extreme observations 
    are more likely). 
  - It is always centered at 0. 
  - It only has one parameter, called the "degrees of freedom", which 
    determines how thick the tails are.
  - Smaller degrees of freedom mean thicker tails, larger degrees of freedom
    means thinner tails.
  - If the degrees of freedom is large enough, the $t$-distribution
    is approximately the same as a normal distribution with mean 0
    and variance 1.
      
-   $t$-distributions with different degrees of freedom:

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| fig-alt: "T-densities with different degrees of freedom."
    x <- seq(-4, 4, length = 200)
    data.frame(df = as.factor(c(rep(1, length(x)), rep(5, length(x)), rep(Inf, length(x)))),
               x = c(x, x, x),
               y = c(dt(x = x, df = 1),
                     dt(x = x, df = 5),
                     dt(x = x, df = Inf))) ->
      dfdat

# All of Statistics

- **Observational/experimental Units**: The people/places/things/animals/groups
  that we collect information about. Also known as "individuals" or "cases".
  Sometimes I just say "units".
  
- **Variable**: A property of the observational/experimental units. 
    - E.g.: height of a person, area of a country, marital status.
    
- **Value**: The specific level of a variable for an observational/experimental 
  unit.
    - E.g.: Bob is 5'11'', China has an area of 3,705,407 square miles, Jane is divorced.
    
- **Quantitative Variable**: The variable takes on numerical values where arithmetic 
  operations (plus/minus/divide/times) make sense. 
    - E.g.: height, weight, area, income.
    - Counterexample: Phone numbers, social security numbers.
    
- **Categorical Variable**: The variable puts observational/experimental units 
  into different groups/categories based on the values of that variable.
    - E.g.: race/ethnicity, marital status, religion.

- **Binary Variable**: A categorical variable that takes on only two values.
    - E.g.: dead/alive, treatment/control.
    
- **Population**: The collection of all observational units we are interested in. 

- **Parameter**: A numerical summary of the population.
    - E.g.: Average height, proportion of people who are divorced, standard
      deviation of weight.

- **Sample**: A subset of the population (some observational units, but 
  not all of them).

- **Statistic**: A numeric summary of the sample.
    - E.g.: Average height of the sample, proportion of people who are 
      divorced in the sample, standard deviation of weight of a sample.
      
- Graphic:
    
  ![](./cartoons/pop_vs_sample.png){fig-alt="Population versus sample."}\ 

- **Sampling Distribution**: The distribution of a statistic over
  many hypothetical random samples from the population.
  
  ![](./cartoons/sampling_dist.png){fig-alt="Sampling distribution visualization."}\ 

- All of Statistics: We see a pattern in the sample.
    - **Estimation**: Guess the pattern in the population based on the sample. 
      Guess a parameter with a statistic. A statistic which is a guess for a 
      parameter is called an **estimate**.
    - **Hypothesis Testing**: Ask if the pattern we see in the sample also
      exists in the population. Test if a parameter is some value.
    - **Confidence Intervals**: Quantify our (un)certainty of the pattern 
      in the population based on the sample. Provide a range of likely 
      parameter values.

-   We will go through a lot of examples of this below

## Solution
- Observational units: Twins
- Variables: `ID` is a key. `zyg`, `men1`, and `men2` are categorical. The rest are quantitative.

# Pattern: Mean is shifted (one quantitative variable)

- Example: The `boneden` data explores the difference in bone density between a heavier and a lighter smoking twin.
  
- Observational Units: The twins.

- Population: All twins where one smokes more than the other.
  
- Sample: The 41 twins in our study.
  
-   Variable: The difference in lumbar spine density (in g/cm^2^) between the twins. We derived this quantitative variable by subtracting one density from another.
    ```{r}
    #| message: false
    boneden <- read_csv("https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_320/data/boneden.csv")
    boneden <- mutate(boneden, ls_diff = ls1 - ls2)
    ```

-   Pattern: Use a histogram/boxplot to visualize the shift from 0.

    ```{r}
    #| fig-alt: "Histogram of bone density difference."
    ggplot(boneden, aes(x = ls_diff)) +
      geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "white", color = "black") +
      geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lty = 2) +
      xlab("Difference in Bone Density")
    ```


- Graphic: 

  ![](./cartoons/twins1.png){fig-alt="Visualization of twin sample."}\ 
    
- Parameter of interest: Mean difference in bone density for all twins.

-   Estimate: Use sample mean

    ```{r}
    boneden |>
      summarize(meandiff = mean(ls_diff))
    ```
    
- 0.03585 is our "best guess" for the parameter, but it is almost certainly not
  the value of the parameter (since we didn't measure everyone).

- Hypothesis Testing: 
    - We are interested in if the mean difference is different from 0. 
    - Two possibilities:
        1. **Null Hypothesis**: Mean is not different from 0, we just happened
           *by chance* to get twins that had some difference in density.
        2. **Alternative Hypothesis**: Mean is different from 0.
    - Strategy: We calculate the probability of the data assuming possibility 1 
      (called a $p$-value). If this probability is low, we conclude possibility 2. 
      If the this probability is high, we don't conclude anything.
    - **p-value**: the probability that you would see data as or more 
      supportive of the alternative hypothesis than what you saw 
      *assuming that the null hypothesis is true*.

- Graphic:

  ![](./cartoons/p-value.png){fig-alt="Sampling distribution of sample mean."}\ 
    
- The distribution of possible null sample means is given by statistical theory.
  Specifically, the $t$-statistic (mean divided by the standard deviation of the
  sampling distribution of the mean) has a $t$ distribution with
  $n - 1$ degrees of freedom ($n$ is the sample size). 
  It works as long as your data aren't too skewed or if you have a large 
  enough sample size.

-   Function: `t.test()`

    ```{r}
    tout <- t.test(ls_diff ~ 1, data = boneden)
    tout
    ```
    
-   The `tidy()` function from the broom package will format the output of common procedures to a convenient data frame.
  
    ```{r}
    tdf <- tidy(tout)
    tdf$estimate
    tdf$p.value
    ```
    
-   We often want a range of "likely" values. These are called confidence intervals. `t.test()` will return these confidence intervals, giving lowest and highest likely values for the mean difference in bone density:
    ```{r}
    tdf$conf.low
    tdf$conf.high
    ```
    
- Interpreting confidence intervals:
    - CORRECT: We used a procedure that would capture the true parameter in 95%
      of repeated samples.
    - CORRECT: *Prior to sampling*, the probability of capturing the true
      parameter is 0.95.
    - WRONG: After sampling, the probability of capturing the true parameter
      is 0.95. 
        - Because after sampling the parameter is either in the interval
          or it's not. We just don't know which.
    - WRONG: 95% of twins have bone density differences within the bounds of the 95% 
      confidence interval. 
        - Because confidence intervals are statements about
          parameters, not observational units or statistics.
      
- Graphic:
    
  ![](./cartoons/ci_graphic.png){fig-alt="Interpretation of confidence intervals."}\ 
      
      
- Intuition: Statistical theory tells us that the sample mean will be
  within (approximately) 2 standard deviations of the population 
  mean in 95% of repeated samples. This is two standard deviations
  of the sampling distribution of the sample mean, *not* two standard
  deviations of the sample. So we just add and subtract (approximately)
  two standard deviations of the sampling distribution from the sample mean.

## Exercise
The `birthweight` data available [here](https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_320/data/birthweight.csv) contains the birthweights (in ounces) of 1000 newborns born in a Boston area hospital. Wikipedia [says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_weight) the average birthweight for individuals of European and African descent is 123 ounces. Does this Boston hospital have the same mean as what Wikipedia says? Explain.

## Solution

```{r}
birthweight <- read_csv("https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_320/data/birthweight.csv")
ggplot(birthweight, aes(x = weight)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 123)
mean(birthweight$weight)
```
- Null: mean weight is 123
- Alternative: mean weight not 123
```{r}
tout <- t.test(birthweight$weight, mu = 123)
tout$p.value
```
We have strong evidence the mean birthweight at the Boston hospital is different than the what Wikipedia says (p < 0.0001). There are a few possible explanations. First, we don't know if the Wikipedia figure includes premies, while the Boston data certainly does. Second, we the Boston data likely also includes individuals other than those of African and European descent (e.g. Histpanics and Asians). Third, the Wikipedia article figure is from 2023, while these data might be quite a bit older.

# Pattern: Means of two groups are different (one quantitative, one binary)

-   Example: IQ differences between children with high levels of lead (`exposed`) and those with low levels of lead (`control`).
  
    ```{r}
    #| warning: false
    lead <- read_csv("https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_320/data/lead.csv")
    lead |>
      select(Group, iqf) |>
      glimpse()
    ```

- Observational Units: Children

- Population: All children

- Sample: The 120 children for whom we have both lead and IQ measurements.

- Variables: The lead level group (binary/categorical) and the
  full scale IQ (quantitative).
  
-   Pattern: Use a boxplot to see if the groups differ.

    ```{r}
    #| warning: false
    #| fig-alt: "Boxplots of IQF by group."
    ggplot(lead, aes(x = Group, y = iqf)) +
      geom_boxplot()
    ```

- Parameter of interest: Difference in mean IQ levels between the control and exposed groups.

-   Estimate: The difference in mean IQ between the two groups in our sample.
    
    ```{r}
    lead |>
      group_by(Group) |>
      summarize(meaniq = mean(iqf, na.rm = TRUE))
    92.55 - 88.02
    ```
    
    The control group is about 4.5 points higher on average
  

- Hypothesis Test:
  - We want to know if the difference in the mean IQ in the two groups is
    actually different.
  - Two possibilities:
    - **Null Hypothesis**: The mean IQs are the same in the two groups. We
      just happened by chance to get a lower IQ lead group and a higher IQ control group.
    - **Alternative Hypothesis**: The mean IQ are different in the two groups.
    - Strategy: We calculate the probability of the data assuming possibility 1
      (called a p-value). If this probability is low, we conclude possibility 2.
      If the this probability is high, we don’t conclude anything.

- The distribution of possible null sample means comes from statistical theory.
  The t-statistic has a $t$ distribution with a complicated degrees of freedom.

-   Function: `t.test()`. The quantitative variable goes to the left of the tilde and the binary variable goes to the right of the tilde.

    ```{r}
    tout <- t.test(iqf ~ Group, data = lead)
    tdf <- tidy(tout)
    tdf$estimate
    tdf$p.value
    ```
    
-   `t.test()` also returns a 95% confidence interval for the difference in means. This has the exact same interpretation as in the previous section.
  
    ```{r}
    c(tdf$conf.low, tdf$conf.high)
    ```
    
- Assumptions (in decreasing order of importance):
  1. Independence: conditional on group, IQ of one child doesn't give us any information on the IQs of any other children (reasonable).
  2. Approximate normality: The distribution of IQ's is bell-curved in group. Doesn't matter for moderate-large sample sizes because of the central limit theorem.

## Exercise
Is there a difference between control and exposed groups when it comes to the finger-wrist tapping test in the dominant hand (`maxfwt`).

## Solution
```{r}
ggplot(lead, aes(x = Group, y = maxfwt)) +
  geom_boxplot()
t.test(maxfwt ~ Group, data = lead) |>
  tidy()
```
We have some evidence that there is a different in mean performance in this test (p = 0.01125). Control children tap about 7 more times in 10 seconds using the dominant hand (95% CI of 1.6 to 12.4 more times).

# Pattern: Proportion is shifted (one binary variable).

-   The exposed individuals were mostly males. There were 30 males and 16 females. In the US, about [51.22% of all births are boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_by_sex_ratio). Are boys more likely to be recruited to the study than girls?

    ```{r}
    lead |>
      filter(Group == "exposed") |>
      group_by(sex) |>
      summarize(n = n())
    ```
  
- Observational Units: U.S. children exposed to lead

- Population: All U.S. children exposed to lead

- Sample: The 46 children in our sample who were exposed to lead.

- Variable: Sex (`male`/`female`)
  
-   Pattern: Calculate sample proportion.

    ```{r}
    30 / 46
    ```

- Parameter of interest: Proportion of children exposed to lead who are boys
  
- Estimate with sample proportion, 0.6522

- Hypothesis Testing:
  - We are interested in if our sample had some bias in selecting more boys.
  - Two possibilities:
      1. **Null Hypothesis**: Probability of a boy being included in the sample is 0.5122. We just happened *by chance* to get a lot more boys.
      2. **Alternative Hypothesis**: There is bias and the probability of a boy being in the sample is greater than for a girl(because boys are more likely to be exposed to lead, or because they were more likely to be recruited to the study).
  - Strategy: We calculate the probability of the data assuming possibility 1
    (called a *p*-value). If this probability is low, we conclude
    possibility 2. If this probability is high, we don't conclude anything.

- The distribution of possible null sample proportions comes from
  statistical theory. The number of successes has a binomial distribution
  with success probability 0.5122 and size parameter equal to the 
  sample size. The sample proportion is the number successes divided by
  the sample size.

-   Function: `prop.test()` (when you have a large number of both successes and failures) or `binom.test()` (for any number of successes and failures).
  
    ```{r}
    bout <- tidy(binom.test(x = 30, n = 46, p = 0.5122))
    bout |>
      select(estimate, p.value, conf.low, conf.high)
    ```
      
    ```{r}
    pout <- tidy(prop.test(x = 30, n = 46, p = 0.5122))
    pout |>
      select(estimate, p.value, conf.low, conf.high)
    ```

## Exercise
Is there a sex bias for the control group?

## Solution
```{r}
  lead |>
    filter(Group == "control") |>
    group_by(sex) |>
    summarize(n = n())
bout <- binom.test(x = 46, n = 46 + 32)
bout$p.value
```
No evidence of a sex bias (p = 0.14)
