These practice problems mostly come from Rosner's publicly available study sheet at the books [companion website](https://www.cengage.com/cgi-wadsworth/course_products_wp.pl?fid=M20b&product_isbn_issn=9781305268920). The solutions are my own, since we differ slightly on what we are looking for in the solutions.

I have only kept the problems most relevant for this course.
