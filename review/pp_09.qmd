These practice problems mostly come from Rosner's publicly available study sheet at the books [companion website](https://www.cengage.com/cgi-wadsworth/course_products_wp.pl?fid=M20b&product_isbn_issn=9781305268920). The solutions are my own, since we differ slightly on what we are looking for in the solutions.

## Ophthalmology

Suppose an ophthalmologist reviews fundus photographs of 30 patients with macular degeneration both before and 3 months after receiving a laser treatment. To assess the efficacy of treatment, each patient is rated as improved, remained the same, or declined.

::: {.panel-tabset}
## 9.1 
If 20 patients improved, 7 declined, and 3 remained the same, then assess whether or not patients undergoing this treatment are showing significant change from baseline to 3 months afterward. Report a p-value. 

## Solutions
This is a sign test. Let $X$ be the number of patients that improved, and let $n$ be the number of patients that showed a change. Then $X \sim \mathrm{Binom}(n, p)$. We want to test $H_0: p = 1/2$ versus $H_A: p \neq 1/2$. We are told that $x = 20$ and $n = 27$. We can use the normal approximation to the binomial since $np_0(1-p_0) \geq 5$
```{r}
25 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5)
```
We calculate the $z$ statistic
$$
z = \frac{|\hat{p} - p_0| - 1/(2n)}{\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)/n}} = \frac{|20/27 - 0.5| - 1/54}{\sqrt{0.5(1-0.5)/27}}
$$
```{r}
(abs(20/27 - 0.5) - 1/54) / sqrt(0.5 * (1 - 0.5) / 27)
```
We compare this to standard normal distribution
```{r}
#| echo: false
plt_t(lb = 2.309, two_sided = TRUE) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2.309, lty = 2)
```
```{r}
2 * pnorm(-2.309)
```
So we have evidence that there is a different from baseline.

The real way in R is
```{r}
prop.test(x = 20, n = 27, p = 0.5) |>
  tidy() |>
  select(p.value)
```

The exact binomial approach, which is always valid, calculates the sum of the probabilities that are at least as probabable as $x = 20$ given $X \sim \mathrm{Binom}(27, 0.5)$
```{r}
#| echo: false
plt_binom(size = 27, prob = 0.5, valmax = 20) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = dbinom(x = 20, size = 27, prob = 0.5), lty = 2)
```
```{r}
binom.test(x = 20, n = 27, p = 0.5) |>
  tidy() |>
  select(p.value)
```

Suppose that the patients are divided into two groups according to initial visual acuity (VA). Of the 14 patients with VA 20-40 or better, 8 improved, 5 declined, and 1 stayed the same. Of the 16 patients with VA worse than 20–40, 12 improved, 2 declined, and 2 stayed the same.

## Diabetes

## Pathology

The data in the following data frame are measurements from a group of 10 normal males and 11 males with left-heart disease taken at autopsy at a particular hospital. Measurements were made on several variables at that time, and the table presents the measurements on total heart weight (THW) and total body weight (BW). Assume that the diagnosis of left-heart disease is made independently of these variables.

```{r}
heart <- tibble(
  status = c(rep("disease", 11), rep("normal", 10)),
  thw = c(450, 760, 325, 495, 285, 450, 460, 375, 310, 615, 425,
          245, 350, 340, 300, 310, 270, 300, 360, 405, 290),
  bw = c(54.6, 73.5, 50.3, 44.6, 58.1, 61.3, 75.3, 41.1, 51.5, 41.7, 59.7,
         40.8, 67.4, 53.3, 62.2, 65.5, 47.5, 51.2, 74.9, 59.0, 40.5)

## Cardiology

Propranolol is a standard drug given to ease the pain of patients with episodes of unstable angina. A new drug for the treatment of this disease is tested on 30 pairs of patients who are matched on a one-to-one basis according to age, sex, and clinical condition and are assessed as to the severity of their pain. Suppose that in 15 pairs of patients, the patient with the new drug has less pain; in 10 pairs of patients, the patient with propranolol has less pain; and in 5 pairs of patients, the pain is about the same with the two drugs.

## Psychiatry

Suppose we are conducting a study of the effectiveness of lithium therapy for manic-depressive patients. The study is carried out at two different centers, and we want to determine if the patient populations are comparable at baseline. A self-rating questionnaire about their general psychological well-being is administered to the prospective patients at the two different centers. The outcome measure on the questionnaire is a four-category scale: (1) = feel good; (2) = usually feel good, once in a while feel nervous; (3) = feel nervous half the time; (4) = usually feel nervous. Suppose the data at the two different centers are as follows:

```{r}
center1 = c(3, 4, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4)
center2 = c(1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3)
```

## Psychiatry

Much attention has been given in recent years to the role of transcendental meditation in improving health, particularly in lowering blood pressure. One hypothesis that emerges from this work is that transcendental meditation might also be useful in treating psychiatric patients with symptoms of anxiety. Suppose that a protocol of meditational therapy is administered once a day to 20 patients with anxiety. The patients are given a psychiatric exam at baseline and at a follow-up exam 2 months later. The degree of improvement is rated on a 10-point scale, with 1 indicating the most improvement and 10 the least improvement. Similarly, 26 comparably affected patients with anxiety are given standard psychotherapy and are asked to come back 2 months later for a follow-up exam. The results are given in Table 9.2.

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Create the tibble
tbl <- tibble(
  `Meditation_d` = 1:10,
  `Meditation_f` = c(3, 4, 7, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
  `Psychotherapy_d` = 1:10,
  `Psychotherapy_f` = c(0, 2, 5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0)
)

# Create the gt table

  gt() |>
  tab_header(
    title = md("**Table 9.2**"),
    subtitle = md("Degree of improvement in patients with anxiety who are treated with transcendental meditation or psychotherapy")

  cols_label(
    Meditation_d = "Degree of Improvement",
    Meditation_f = "Frequency",
    Psychotherapy_d = "Decree of Improvement",
    Psychotherapy_f = "Frequency"

  tab_spanner(
    label = "Meditation",
    columns = c(Meditation_d, Meditation_f)
