I did some cleaning (changing `9`'s to `NA`'s, recoding numerics to informative characters, etc).

# betacar

High doses of beta-carotene in food have been linked to a reduced cancer risk in some observational studies. A clinical trial was planned to compare cancer incidence between a group taking beta-carotene capsules and a placebo group. The study considered four beta-carotene capsule preparations: Solatene (30 mg), Roche (60 mg), and two from BASF (30 mg and 60 mg). To test their effectiveness in raising plasma-carotene levels, 23 volunteers were randomized to one of the four preparations, taking one pill every other day for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the plasma carotene level after prolonged ingestion.

# boneden

A study in Australia examined the relationship between bone density and cigarette smoking in middle-aged female twins with different smoking histories. Forty-one pairs of twins visited a hospital in Victoria, Australia, where their bone density was measured. Participants also completed questionnaires providing information on their tobacco use, alcohol, coffee, and tea consumption, calcium intake from dairy products, menopausal and reproductive history, fracture history, use of oral contraceptives or estrogen replacement therapy, and physical activity levels. Tobacco consumption was measured in pack-years, with one pack-year defined as smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for one year.

# botox

A study on patients with piriformis syndrome compared the effects of three types of injections: triamcinolone with lidocaine (Group 1), a placebo (Group 2), and Botox (Group 3). The patients were randomly assigned to these groups in a 3:1:2 ratio and received injections directly into the piriformis muscle. They were evaluated at 2 weeks, 1 month, and monthly up to 17 months, though many missed visits. Improvement in pain was measured on a scale from 0% to 100%. The study involved 69 patients, with one having the condition in both legs. The goal was to compare the efficacy between the groups, considering age, gender, and affected side as potential influencing factors.

# breast

The data set includes 1200 postmenopausal women from the NHS, free of cancer in 1990. Of these, 200 were using postmenopausal hormones (PMH) in 1990, and 1000 had never used them. The study aimed to link PMH use in 1990 to breast cancer incidence from 1990 to 2000. Fifty-three women developed breast cancer during this period. PMH use was categorized by current use and duration of use in 1990, with separate durations for estrogen and estrogen plus progesterone. Each woman has a return date for the 1990 questionnaire and a follow-up date, which is either the date of breast cancer diagnosis or the date of the last questionnaire by 2000. The file also includes data on other breast cancer risk factors as of 1990.

# corneal

Fluoroquinolones, antibiotics for bacterial infections, are FDA-approved for systemic use. However, post-approval studies indicate a risk of peripheral neuropathy, leading to updated safety labeling.

A small clinical trial tested the safety and effectiveness of two fluoroquinolone eye drops (drugs `M` and `G`) and a placebo (drug `P`) for bacterial eye infections. Ninety-three subjects were randomly assigned to three groups, each receiving one active drug and a placebo in opposite eyes. Participants used the drops four times daily for 10 days. The primary outcome was corneal sensitivity, measured in millimeters, with higher values indicating more normal sensitivity.

Corneal sensitivity was assessed at baseline, 7 days, and 14 days, with measurements taken from the central cornea and four quadrants (superior, inferior, temporal, nasal).

# diabetes

Type I diabetes is common in children and requires regular insulin shots to prevent long-term complications like neurologic, vision, kidney issues, heart disease, and premature death.

The impact of diabetes control on childhood growth is less clear. To study this, adolescent boys aged 9âˆ’15 were examined about every 3 months. Each exam measured diabetes control using glycosylated hemoglobin (HgbA1c), where higher HgbA1c indicates poorer control (normal <7.0). Age, height, and weight were also recorded. Data includes 94 boys over 910 visits.

The main question is the overall relationship between glycemic control and growth, primarily weight, for the entire group, not individual cases.

# eff, nephro, and oto

Aminoglycoside antibiotics are crucial for treating severe gram-negative bacterial infections in hospitalized patients. Despite their toxicity and the development of new antibiotics, aminoglycosides remain widely used. Choosing the right aminoglycoside depends on the clinical situation, antimicrobial spectrum, cost, and side effects like nephrotoxicity and auditory toxicity. Numerous trials comparing these antibiotics have varied in design and conclusions, often lacking sufficient sample sizes to detect small differences. 

To better understand their true effects, a meta-analysis of all randomized trials was conducted. This analysis included 45 trials from 1975 to 1985, comparing amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, sisomicin, and tobramycin. Data from 37 trials were suitable for comparison, focusing on efficacy, nephrotoxicity, and auditory toxicity. Efficacy was defined by bacterial or clinical response as reported by each trial, nephrotoxicity by the percentage of kidney-related toxic events reported, and auditory toxicity by the diffence in pre- and post-treatment audiograms. The data is organized into three sets: eff.csv, nephro.csv, and oto.csv, with separate records for each antibiotic and endpoint.

Obesity is common in American society and a risk factor for breast cancer in postmenopausal women, possibly due to increased estrogen levels, particularly serum estradiol. Researchers studied 151 African American and 60 Caucasian premenopausal women, measuring adiposity using body mass index (BMI) (a measure of overall adioposity) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) (a measure of abdominal adioposity). They also obtained a complete hormonal profile, including serum estradiol, and assessed other breast cancer risk factors: ethnicity, age, number of children, age at first birth, presence of children, and age at menarche.

# hormone

An experiment was conducted to study the effects of avian pancreatic polypeptide (aPP), cholecystokinin (CCK), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and secretin on pancreatic and biliary secretions in laying hens. Researchers aimed to determine how these hormones affect the flow rates and pH values of these secretions.

White Leghorn hens, aged 14-29 weeks, were surgically fitted with cannulas for collecting secretions and a jugular cannula for hormone infusion. Each hen underwent one trial per day, as long as her cannulas remained functional, leading to varying trial numbers per hen. 

Each trial started with a 20-minute saline infusion, followed by the collection of pancreatic and biliary secretions. The flow rates and pH values were measured. This was followed by a 40-minute hormone infusion, with measurements repeated afterward.

The data set "hormone.csv" includes data for the four hormones and saline, with each trial recorded as one entry and 11 associated variables.

# lead

A study examined the psychological and neurological effects of lead exposure on children near a lead smelter in El Paso, Texas. Blood lead levels were measured, categorizing 46 children with levels â‰¥ 40 Î¼g/mL as the exposed group and 78 children with levels < 40 Î¼g/mL as the control group. Key outcomes included fingerâ€“wrist taps (neurological function) and Wechsler full-scale IQ scores.

Other behavioral effects of lead include hyperactivity. In this study, parents also rated their childrenâ€™s hyperactivity on a scale from 0 (normal) to 3 (very hyperactive). Hyperactivity measures are available for 49 control children and 35 exposed children.
