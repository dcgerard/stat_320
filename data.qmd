  - `Min_last`: Minutes elapsed since last cigarette missing=9999  
  - `LogCOadj`: Log CO Adj * (X 1000)  missing=9999. This variable represents adjusted carbon monoxide (CO) values. CO values were adjusted for minutes elapsed since last cigarette smoked using the formula Log 10 CO (Adjusted) = Log 10 CO - (-0.000638) X (Min - 80), where Min is the number of minutes elapsed since the last cigarette smoked.
  - `Day_abs`: Days abstinent  Those abstinent less than 1 day were given a value of zero.
