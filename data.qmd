# betacar

High doses of beta-carotene in food have been linked to a reduced cancer risk in some observational studies. A study considered four beta-carotene capsule preparations: Solatene (30 mg), Roche (60 mg), and two from BASF (30 mg and 60 mg). To test their effectiveness in raising plasma-carotene levels, 23 volunteers were randomized to one of the four preparations, taking one pill every other day for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the plasma carotene level after prolonged ingestion.

# boneden

A study in Australia examined the relationship between bone density and cigarette smoking in middle-aged female twins with different smoking histories. Forty-one pairs of twins visited a hospital in Victoria, Australia, where their bone density was measured. Participants also completed questionnaires providing information on their tobacco use, alcohol, coffee, and tea consumption, calcium intake from dairy products, menopausal and reproductive history, fracture history, use of oral contraceptives or estrogen replacement therapy, and physical activity levels. Tobacco consumption was measured in pack-years, with one pack-year defined as smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for one year.

# botox

A study on patients with piriformis syndrome compared the effects of three types of injections: triamcinolone with lidocaine (`TL`), a placebo (`Placebo`), and Botox (`Botox`). The patients were randomly assigned to these groups in a 3:1:2 ratio and received injections directly into the piriformis muscle. They were evaluated at 2 weeks, 1 month, and monthly up to 17 months, though many missed visits. Improvement in pain was measured on a scale from 0% to 100% (higher means more improved). The study involved 69 patients, with one having the condition in both legs. The goal was to compare the efficacy between the groups, considering age, gender, and affected side as potential influencing factors.

# breast

The data set includes 1200 postmenopausal women from the NHS, free of cancer in 1990. Of these, 200 were using postmenopausal hormones (PMH) in 1990, and 1000 had never used them. The study aimed to link PMH use in 1990 to breast cancer incidence from 1990 to 2000. Fifty-three women developed breast cancer during this period. PMH use was categorized by current use and duration of use in 1990, with separate durations for estrogen and estrogen plus progesterone. Each woman has a return date for the 1990 questionnaire and a follow-up date, which is either the date of breast cancer diagnosis or the date of the last questionnaire by 2000. The file also includes data on other breast cancer risk factors as of 1990.

# corneal

Fluoroquinolones, antibiotics for bacterial infections, are FDA-approved for systemic use. However, post-approval studies indicate a risk of peripheral neuropathy, leading to updated safety labeling.

A small clinical trial tested the safety and effectiveness of two fluoroquinolone eye drops (drugs `M` and `G`) and a placebo (drug `P`) for bacterial eye infections. Ninety-three subjects were randomly assigned to three groups, each receiving one active drug and a placebo in opposite eyes. Participants used the drops four times daily for 10 days. The primary outcome was corneal sensitivity, measured in millimeters, with higher values indicating more normal sensitivity.

Corneal sensitivity was assessed at baseline, 7 days, and 14 days, with measurements taken from the central cornea and four quadrants (superior, inferior, temporal, nasal).

# diabetes

Type I diabetes is common in children and requires regular insulin shots to prevent long-term complications like neurologic, vision, kidney issues, heart disease, and premature death.

The impact of diabetes control on childhood growth is less clear. To study this, adolescent boys aged 9âˆ’15 were examined about every 3 months. Each exam measured diabetes control using glycosylated hemoglobin (HgbA1c), where higher HgbA1c indicates poorer control (normal <7.0). Age, height, and weight were also recorded. Data includes 94 boys over 910 visits.

The main question is the overall relationship between glycemic control and growth, primarily weight, for the entire group, not individual cases.

# eff, nephro, and oto

Aminoglycoside antibiotics are crucial for treating severe gram-negative bacterial infections in hospitalized patients. Despite their toxicity and the development of new antibiotics, aminoglycosides remain widely used. Choosing the right aminoglycoside depends on the clinical situation, antimicrobial spectrum, cost, and side effects like nephrotoxicity and auditory toxicity. Numerous trials comparing these antibiotics have varied in design and conclusions, often lacking sufficient sample sizes to detect small differences.

To better understand their true effects, a meta-analysis of all randomized trials was conducted. This analysis included 45 trials from 1975 to 1985, comparing amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, sisomicin, and tobramycin. Data from 37 trials were suitable for comparison, focusing on efficacy, nephrotoxicity, and auditory toxicity. Efficacy was defined by bacterial or clinical response as reported by each trial, nephrotoxicity by the percentage of kidney-related toxic events reported, and auditory toxicity by the diffence in pre- and post-treatment audiograms. The data is organized into three sets: eff.csv, nephro.csv, and oto.csv, with separate records for each antibiotic and endpoint.

# hormone

An experiment was conducted to study the effects of avian pancreatic polypeptide (aPP), cholecystokinin (CCK), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and secretin on pancreatic and biliary secretions in laying hens. Researchers aimed to determine how these hormones affect the flow rates and pH values of these secretions.

White Leghorn hens, aged 14-29 weeks, were surgically fitted with cannulas for collecting secretions and a jugular cannula for hormone infusion. Each hen underwent one trial per day, as long as her cannulas remained functional, leading to varying trial numbers per hen.

Each trial started with a 20-minute saline infusion, followed by the collection of pancreatic and biliary secretions. The flow rates and pH values were measured. This was followed by a 40-minute hormone infusion, with measurements repeated afterward.

The data set "hormone.csv" includes data for the four hormones and saline, with each trial recorded as one entry and 11 associated variables.

# lead

A study examined the psychological and neurological effects of lead exposure on children near a lead smelter in El Paso, Texas. Blood lead levels were measured, categorizing 46 children with levels â‰¥ 40 Î¼g/mL as the exposed group. Another 78 children with levels < 40 Î¼g/mL functioned as the control group. Key outcomes included fingerâ€“wrist taps (neurological function) and Wechsler full-scale IQ scores.

Other behavioral effects of lead include hyperactivity. In this study, parents also rated their childrenâ€™s hyperactivity on a scale from 0 (normal) to 3 (very hyperactive). Hyperactivity measures are available for 49 control children and 35 exposed children.

# mice

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a hereditary eye condition causing night blindness and visual field loss, typically between ages 10 and 40. Some patients become legally blind by 30, while others retain central vision past 60. A specific gene linked RP has been identified whose transmision is autosomal dominant. The disease progression is tracked using electroretinogram (ERG), measuring retinal electrical activity, which decreases as RP advances, affecting routine activities like driving and walking at night.

To test if sunlight exposure harms RP patients, researchers introduced the RP gene into mice, creating "RP mice." These mice were divided into light, dim, and dark lighting conditions from birth. A control group of normal mice was also subjected to similar conditions. ERG amplitudes (BAMP and AAMP) were measured at 15, 20, and 35 days of life for RP mice, and only BAMP was measured for normal mice.

# nifed

A clinical trial tested the effectiveness of nifedipine in reducing chest pain in hospitalized angina patients. The study lasted 14 days unless patients were withdrawn, discharged, or died. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either nifedipine or propranolol, starting at a standard dosage. If pain persisted or recurred, the dosage was increased in pre-specified steps. Patients in both groups could also receive nitrates as needed to control pain. The primary goal was to compare pain relief between nifedipine and propranolol, with a secondary goal of examining their effects on heart rate and blood pressure.

(b) the patient achieved pain relief prior to reaching this level or therapy,
(c) the patient encountered this level of therapy, but this particular piece of data was missing.

# piriform

A study evaluated the FAIR test (hip flexion, adduction, and internal rotation) for diagnosing piriformis syndrome (PS), which affects the piriformis muscle in the buttock, causing lumbar and sciatic pain. The test measures nerve-conduction velocity differences between an aggravating and a neutral posture, with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of PS. Data from 142 participants without PS and 489 with PS (diagnosed clinically) are available. A FAIR test score of â‰¥ 1.86 ms is proposed to define a positive result. The FAIR test value, MAXCHG, is recorded in milliseconds.

# smoke

A study was conducted among 234 individuals who wanted to quit smoking but had not yet done so. On the day they quit, their carbon monoxide (CO) levels were measured, and the time since their last cigarette was recorded. This CO level serves as an indicator of the number of cigarettes smoked daily before quitting but is influenced by the time since the last cigarette. Therefore, a "corrected CO level" was provided, adjusted for this time. Participant age, sex, and self-reported daily cigarette consumption were also recorded. The participants were followed for a year to determine the number of days they remained abstinent, ranging from 0 to 365 days.

  - `Day_abs`: Days abstinent  Those abstinent less than 1 day were given a value of zero.

# swiss

The Swiss Analgesic Study aimed to evaluate the impact of phenacetin-containing analgesics on kidney function and health. It involved 624 women from Basel, Switzerland, who had high phenacetin intake (study group) and 626 women with low or no phenacetin intake (control group). The study used urine N-acetyl-P-aminophenyl (NAPAP) levels to measure recent phenacetin use, dividing the study group into high-NAPAP and low-NAPAP subgroups. Both subgroups had higher NAPAP levels than the control group. The women were examined in 1967-1968 and again in 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1975, and 1978, with kidney function assessed through various laboratory tests, including serum-creatinine levels.

# tear

A pilot study was conducted to evaluate an eye drop's effectiveness in preventing dry eye, measured by tear breakup time (TBUT). Fourteen participants tested three protocols:

- Protocol A: No blinking for 3 seconds before placebo instillation.
- Protocol B: No blinking for 6 seconds before placebo instillation (standard protocol).
- Protocol C: No blinking for 10 seconds before placebo instillation.

TBUT was recorded at baseline, immediately after, and at 5, 10, and 15 minutes post-instillation in a low-humidity environment. Each protocol was tested on the same participants, measuring both eyes with two replicates.

# tennis2

Tennis elbow is a painful condition common among tennis players. Treatments include rest, heat, and anti-inflammatory medications like Motrin (ibuprofen). A clinical trial with 87 participants compared the effectiveness of Motrin vs. placebo. Participants were randomly divided into two groups: Group A received Motrin for 3 weeks, followed by a 2-week washout period, and then placebo for 3 weeks; Group B received the treatments in reverse order. Pain levels were measured on a 1-6 scale (1 = worse, 6 = completely improved) at the end of each treatment and washout period. The comparison was made (i) during  maximum  activity, (ii) 12  hours following maximum activity, (iii) during the average day, and  (iv) by overall impression of drug efficacy.

# valid

The food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) is a common tool in dietary epidemiology to assess food consumption. It asks individuals to report their typical daily servings of over 100 food items from the past year, and a food-composition table calculates nutrient intakes. While FFQs are inexpensive, they are less accurate than diet records (DR), where participants document their weekly food intake, and a nutritionist calculates nutrient intakes. In a validation study, 173 nurses from the Nurses' Health Study completed 4 weeks of diet records and an FFQ. Data for saturated fat, total fat, alcohol consumption, and caloric intake from both methods recorded here.
