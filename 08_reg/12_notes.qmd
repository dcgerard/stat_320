# Learning Objectives

- ANOVA
- Chapter 12 of Rosner

# Interpreting Models

- ANOVA is just multiple linear regression with categorical explanatory variable(s).

- ANCOVA is just multiple linear regression with a categorical explanatory variable of interest and a few other explanatory variables, at least one of which is continuous.

- There are really only two differences:
  1. The notation.
  2. More emphasis on reporting sums of squares.
